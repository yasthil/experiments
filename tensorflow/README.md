# Using Tensorflow to detect images via a webcam
## Dependencies
- OpenCV

## Instructions:
- Tensorflow: 
    - [Tensorflow install](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
    - [Object Detection Installation](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md)
    - [Protobuf releases](https://github.com/google/protobuf/releases)
- OpenCV:
    - [Mac](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/09/29/macos-for-deep-learning-with-python-tensorflow-and-keras/)
    - Windows: 
        - [Install pip](https://pythonprogramming.net/using-pip-install-for-python-modules/)
        - Get .whl file from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv)

Run this inside of tensorflow/models/research/object_detection/ because this script makes use of 'utils' which is located there.
