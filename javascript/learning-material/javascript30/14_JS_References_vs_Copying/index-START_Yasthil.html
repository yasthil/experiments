    // Let's say we have an array

    const team = players;

    console.log(players, team);
    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    //team[3] = 'Lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    team4[3] = 'Hakuna Matata';
    console.log(team4);

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number:99});
    console.log(captain2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    };

    console.clear();
    console.log(yas);
    
    const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);
    // this only does a 1 later deep copy.

    // if you want to do a complete deep copy, you will need to use a function or a JSON hack
    //const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(yas));
